    "overview": "As pet owners, the founders of Wagmo understood that basic procedures such as vaccinations, grooming, and bloodwork could quickly accumulate four-digit bills, and they saw an opportunity to create a unique platform that would make everyday pet care more affordable. While most pet insurance providers only focus on medical emergencies, Wagmo's platform covers both urgent care and essential services. Following several successful seed rounds, the company engaged with me  to enhance the platform's functionality. To improve customer service and keep pace with the ongoing digital transformation, Wagmo needed to move beyond Excel spreadsheets. Therefore, we migrated all client data to a dedicated app, enabling streamlined insurance plan management and more efficient client onboarding.",

Leveraging our deep regression testing expertise, we employed QA automation for the rapid implementation of multiple mission-critical features. Additionally, I utilised our AWS partnership to achieve exceptional solution performance and agility, as well as the potential for unlimited growth in the future.",
